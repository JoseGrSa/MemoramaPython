# MemoramaPython

A project I did with a friend from school.

It is a working Memorama made in Python, where you can run the .py and then in the console write follow the instruccions and pay attention to the interactive display.
You can select a line and row to find a number and then select another, if a match is found, it will be displayed, if not then it will return to blanks.
This game can be a two player game and has win states and fail states.
